- Research Scientist at INformation Security and Privacy: Interdisciplinary Research and Education [(INSPIRE)](https://inspire.gsu.edu/) center
- Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/), Department of [Computer Science](https://csds.gsu.edu/)
- Advised by Prof. [Daniel Takabi](https://www.odu.edu/article/odu-names-daniel-takabi-as-director-for-school-of-cybersecurity), and Prof. [Zhipeng Cai](https://cai.csgsu.org/)


Research Interest: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence <br/><br/>
I am a last-year PhD candidate specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML/LLMs), with a strong background in various programming languages. Highly motivated, I have contributed to several research projects and publications over the years, showcasing my expertise and dedication to the field. With 8 years of expertise in NLP models and tasks, over 4 years of experience in secure AI, and robust PLMs & LLMs, I am a Robust Machine Learning Researcher proficient in programming languages and algorithm design, with over 10 years of experience. I am currently conducting research aimed at enhancing the robustness and efficiency of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for adversarial NLP applications, and I am scheduled to defend my PhD dissertation in the next few weeks. Actively seeking full-time or part-time positions as an NLP/Generative AI Scientist or Machine Learning Researcher, I am eager to contribute to the further development of robust and efficient PLMs/LLMs for real-world applications. 
 <br/>
Previously, I participated in an industrial project aimed at detecting various types of plagiarism in scientific papers. I developed an effective method to retrieve source documents containing plagiarism from a substantial corpus of 2.5 million. Furthermore, I played an integral role in the development of a sophisticated text alignment framework, where I explored fundamental data mining techniques to precisely detect text reuse segments.<br/>
