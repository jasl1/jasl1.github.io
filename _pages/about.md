Research Interest: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, and Information Retrieval <br/>
"I am currently conducting research aimed at enhancing the robustness and efficiency of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for adversarial NLP applications. I am scheduled to defend my PhD dissertation in the next few months and am actively seeking job opportunities where I can contribute to the further development of robust and efficient PLMs/LLMs for real-world applications. <br/>
Previously, I participated in an industrial project aimed at detecting various types of plagiarism in scientific papers and theses. I designed a method to retrieve source documents from a substantial corpus of 250K by utilizing keyword/keyphrase extraction techniques. <br/>
