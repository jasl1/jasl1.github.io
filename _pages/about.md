- Research Scientist at INformation Security and Privacy: Interdisciplinary Research and Education [(INSPIRE)](https://inspire.gsu.edu/) center
- Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/), Department of [Computer Science](https://csds.gsu.edu/)
- Advised by Prof. [Daniel Takabi](https://www.odu.edu/article/odu-names-daniel-takabi-as-director-for-school-of-cybersecurity), and Prof. [Zhipeng Cai](https://cai.csgsu.org/)


Research Interest: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, and Information Retrieval <br/><br/>
I am currently conducting research aimed at enhancing the robustness and efficiency of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for adversarial NLP applications. I am scheduled to defend my PhD dissertation in the next few months and am actively seeking job opportunities where I can contribute to the further development of robust and efficient PLMs/LLMs for real-world applications. <br/>
Previously, I participated in an industrial project aimed at detecting various types of plagiarism in scientific papers and theses. I designed a method to retrieve source documents from a substantial corpus of 250K by utilizing keyword/keyphrase extraction techniques. <br/>
