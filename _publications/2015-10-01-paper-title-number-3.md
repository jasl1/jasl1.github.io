The paper proposes RobustEmbed, a self-supervised sentence embedding framework aimed at enhancing both generalization and robustness in text representation tasks and adversarial scenarios. By generating high-risk adversarial perturbations and leveraging a novel contrastive objective approach, RobustEmbed effectively learns high-quality sentence embeddings.
