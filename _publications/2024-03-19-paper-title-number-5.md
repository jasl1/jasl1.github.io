excerpt: 'This paper introduces RobustSentEmbed, a method for obtaining robust sentence embeddings through an iterative collaboration between an adversarial perturbation generator and a PLM-based encoder. By generating high-risk perturbations in both token-level and sentence-level embedding spaces, RobustSentEmbed employs a contrastive learning objective combined with a token replacement detection objective to enhance similarity between original and adversarial embeddings.'

This paper introduces RobustSentEmbed, a method for obtaining robust sentence embeddings through an iterative collaboration between an adversarial perturbation generator and a PLM-based encoder. By generating high-risk perturbations in both token-level and sentence-level embedding spaces, RobustSentEmbed employs a contrastive learning objective combined with a token replacement detection objective to enhance similarity between original and adversarial embeddings.
