excerpt: 'The paper presents SSCAE, a novel method for crafting high-quality adversarial examples (AEs) in natural language processing (NLP). SSCAE utilizes a masked language model to identify key words and generate substitutions, which are then evaluated by two language models for semantic and syntactic accuracy. Incorporating dynamic thresholds and local greedy search, SSCAE efficiently generates imperceptible AEs that maintain semantic and syntactic consistency.'

The paper presents SSCAE, a novel method for crafting high-quality adversarial examples (AEs) in natural language processing (NLP). SSCAE utilizes a masked language model to identify key words and generate substitutions, which are then evaluated by two language models for semantic and syntactic accuracy. Incorporating dynamic thresholds and local greedy search, SSCAE efficiently generates imperceptible AEs that maintain semantic and syntactic consistency.
