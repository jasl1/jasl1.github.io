excerpt: 'This paper addresses the task of source retrieval from a large textual documents corpus. It introduces two methods for extracting important terms: weighted noun phrases and keyword phrases from lengthy sentences based on word count. Queries are formed from top-ranked sentences, and the system collects a comprehensive dataset of downloaded sources for query filtering. Each query is divided into two sub-queries, and the system extracts one snippet for each sub-query for downloading.'

This paper addresses the task of source retrieval from a large textual documents corpus. It introduces two methods for extracting important terms: weighted noun phrases and keyword phrases from lengthy sentences based on word count. Queries are formed from top-ranked sentences, and the system collects a comprehensive dataset of downloaded sources for query filtering. Each query is divided into two sub-queries, and the system extracts one snippet for each sub-query for downloading.
