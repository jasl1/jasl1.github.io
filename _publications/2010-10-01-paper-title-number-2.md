title: "TSAKE: A topical and structural automatic keyphrase extractor"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-08-31-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This paper introduces TSAKE, a novel approach for automatic keyphrase extraction that leverages both N-gram topical models and co-occurrence graphs. Unlike traditional methods, TSAKE weights edges in the co-occurrence graph using the topic model and applies network analysis to identify finer-grained sub-topics. By incorporating these insights, TSAKE outperforms baseline techniques and state-of-the-art models in keyphrase extraction tasks.'
